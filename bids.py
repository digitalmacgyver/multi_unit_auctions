Welcome to my Discount Lightning $8k Order Auction No. %d.

I dropped the initial reserves for several items in this auction.

By now you know the drill: Faster, Cheaper, and high Transparency.  Details in Post #2.

[size=5][b]How bidding works:[/b][/size]

[ul]
  [li]A bid on a set of identical items is recorded as: (Bidder, Max Bid, Quantity, Time of Bid)[/li]
  [li]A sorted list of all bids for an item is maintained sorted by descending Max Bid, ascending Time[/li]
  [li]Winning bidders are allocated items by going down the sorted list and allocating items up to desired Quantity until all items have been allocated[/li]
  [li]The winning bid amount is the Max Bid amount of the first bid to not have their whole requested quantity
  [ul][li]All winning bidders pay the same amount[/li][/ul][/li]
[/ul]

I'll update the currently leading bidders in this post, quantities, and the current bid price by pseudonym as new bids come in.

If you'd like to learn more, see the example below in the second post on this thread.

[b]Threshold and Timelines:[/b]
[ul]
  [li]The auction will end as soon as I process a bid that puts the total value at or over $7,500, including the value of all items still at their reserve price.[/li]
  [li]PyP choices are due at the time of payment.[/li]
  [li]If the $7,500 threshold is not met by 10/31 the auction is not funded and will be cancelled.[/li]
  [li]Items will be mailed to you within 1 week after my receipt of them from True Adventures.  Be forewarned that some items (like adventure modules) are sent out by True Adventures much later than others.[/li]
[/ul]

[b]Shipping:[/b] Within the US: $8 per customer.  Outside the US: Actual shipping cost.  You may choose to announce your pseudonym after the auction in exchange for free shipping to the US, or an $8 discount on shipping outside the US.

[b]Payment:[/b] Is via PayPal and due within 3 days of me notifying you of your won bid.  The amount that reaches my PayPal account must be the sum of your won bids and shipping.

[size=6][b]Current Bids:[/b][/size]

''' % ( CURRENT_NO )

#NOTE: You may redeem 2 PyP selections for a complete C/UC/R ONYX Set.  You may redeem 18 PyP selections for a complete C/UC/R/UR ONYX Set.  Limit one such substitution per auction, priority will be given to winning bidders in order of highest bidder first, breaking ties on earliest bid.
